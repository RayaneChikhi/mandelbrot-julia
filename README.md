# mandelbrot-julia
Generates the Mandelbrot and Julia sets.

I wanted to generate this because of how beautiful these two sets are. Moreover, Mandelbrot prepared the same entrance exams as me in the same CPGE (Lyc√©e du Parc) as me which got me quite interested
in his work !

Feel free to experiment by changing the following variables and their default values : 

mandelbrot_width = 2000
mandelbrot_height = 2000
re_start = -0.22
re_end = -0.219
im_start = -0.70
im_end = -0.699


julia_width = 2000
julia_height = 2000
julia_re_start = -0.5
julia_re_end = 0.3
julia_im_start = -0.5
julia_im_end = 0.3

By default, it is pretty zoomed in, you can get a less zoomed in picture by having a wider range for re_start and re_end, im_start and im_end. If you want to have as many pixels as possible, i.e being
able to zoom in as much as you want while keeping a good resolution, increase mandelbrot/julia-width and mandelbrot/julia-height.

Here are a few pictures. Enjoy !
